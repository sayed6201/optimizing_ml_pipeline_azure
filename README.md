# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This dataset contains data about marketing campaigns based on phone calls of a Portuguese banking institution. We seek to predict to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.


**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The best perfoming model was Voting Ensemble model having accuracy 91.65 % followed by MaxAbsScaler, LightGBM having accuracy of 91.39%. The best performing model was derived using Azure AutoML.
The same dataset was also used to train Logistic regression model and Parameters were tuned using Azure Hyperdrive which resulted in 91.32% accuracy.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
### The pipeline architecture
* The tabular dataset is created using TabularDatasetFactory from the the link
* The dataset is cleaned using python script. cleaning includes encoding categorical values, representing some non numeric values into numeric format 
* The data is splitted into test and train set. the test:train ration is 20:80
* The data is used to train LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model. SKLearn estimator from azureml.train.sklearn is used to run the trainnig script
* The model LogisticRegression takes two hyperparameters inverse of regularization strength (--C) and Max iterations (--max_iter), Using Azure Hyper Drive this paremeters are tuned to get model with best accuracy.
**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
### Benefits of the parameter sampler


**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
